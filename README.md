## Last updated February 9, 2017

Updated with new location of Hacker Dojo (old one has been left intact for historical purposes) üë©üèΩ‚Äç

# Future Improvements
 
I'd like to get this set up with Gulp so I can automate adding new locations and make updating this app easier! That'd be awesome.

I'd also like to add some new flourishes... this app seems to be getting forked a fair bit, and I'm hoping that's not because of anything that wouldn't be "Udacious"...
