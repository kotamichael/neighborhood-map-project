This project is designed for use primarily on a laptop or tablet, but it has been optimized for phone screens as well.  If you're interested in the app's responsiveness, you can open developer tools in your browser and resize the screen, or simply open run the app from another machine.

# How To Use

1. Click here to try the [online demo](https://kotamichael.github.io/neighborhood-map-project/).  Alternatively checkout 'step 2'.
2. In order to run the app locally, clone and/or fork the repository to your local machine.  Then simply open ```index.html``` in your browser. If you want to run it from a server, that would be a more involved process, but google chrome does offer several simple servers, and a quick google search would yield several entries along the same vein.
3. Click on any of the places on the map / sidebar for more information. Except for Mount Jefferson, every site has a photo associated with it.  For some reason Mount Jefferson hasn't been shown any love with pictures yet, but as soon as some one adds a photo of it to Foursquare, it'll automatically show up.
4. The "All the cool places" dropdown menu displays the names of all the markers on the map.  Type in the search area if you only want to see a few of the places listed on the map to make it easier to spot. You can click on any location to display more information in either the sidebar or the marker itself. If you want to eliminate the sidebar, simply click the "hamburger icon" in the top left of the black navigation bar and the sidebar toggles out of screen with a nifty animation.
5. The information shown in the pop-up window is powered by the Foursquare API.

# Future Improvements
 
I'd like to get this set up with Gulp so I can automate adding new locations and make updating this app easier! That'd be awesome.

# Acknowledgements

I'm indebted firstly to Fullstack Nanodegree faculty.  The Knockout JS and Foursquare API Documentation were heavily relied upon for the functionality of the app. [This blog entry](https://bootstrapious.com/p/bootstrap-sidebar) is one of many fantastic tutorials on this site, and I would highly recomment anyone interested in the sidebar toggle animation and css styling in general give the entry and site a once-over.  In order to get the array filter working properly, I referred to [this entry](http://www.knockmeout.net/2011/04/utility-functions-in-knockoutjs.html) on the Knockout utility functions.
